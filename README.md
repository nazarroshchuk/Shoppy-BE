## Prisma

Run the following command in your project root:

```bash
   npx prisma generate
```

üí° Optional: Add it to your postinstall script
To make sure this doesn‚Äôt happen again (e.g., when other developers clone your repo), add this line to your package.json:

```bash
     "scripts": {
      "postinstall": "prisma generate"
    } 
```

üîÅ Full workflow (in order):
if you haven‚Äôt already.

````bash
    npx prisma init
````


Update your prisma/schema.prisma.

Run:
````bash
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
````
````bash
    npx prisma generate
````
